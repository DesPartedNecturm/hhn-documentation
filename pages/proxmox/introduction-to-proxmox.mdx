# Introduction to Proxmox

Welcome to the Introduction to Proxmox guide! In this section, we'll provide you
with an overview of Proxmox Virtual Environment
[(Proxmox VE)](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview),
an open-source platform for enterprise virtualization. Whether you're new to
Proxmox or looking to deepen your understanding, this guide will cover the
basics and key features of Proxmox VE.

## What is Proxmox?

Proxmox VE is a powerful and flexible virtualization platform that combines the
features of virtualization, containerization, and software-defined storage in a
single solution. It allows you to run and manage virtual machines (VMs) and
containers on a single host or across a cluster of hosts, providing a
centralized and efficient infrastructure for your IT environment.

## Key Features

### Virtualization

- Proxmox VE supports various virtualization technologies, including KVM
  (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for full virtualization and LXC (Linux
  Containers) for lightweight containerization.
- It offers a user-friendly web-based interface (Proxmox VE Dashboard) for
  managing VMs, containers, storage, and networking resources.

### High Availability

- Proxmox VE includes built-in high availability (HA) features, allowing you to
  create resilient and fault-tolerant virtualized environments.
- HA clustering ensures automatic failover and resource migration in case of
  host failures, maximizing uptime and reliability.

### Software-Defined Storage

- Proxmox VE integrates software-defined storage solutions such as ZFS
  (Zettabyte File System) and Ceph for scalable and resilient storage
  management.
- It supports features like thin provisioning, snapshots, and data replication,
  enabling efficient storage utilization and data protection.

### Networking

- Proxmox VE provides comprehensive networking capabilities, including virtual
  network interfaces, VLAN tagging, and firewall management.
- It supports software-defined networking (SDN) features for creating and
  managing virtual networks within your infrastructure.
