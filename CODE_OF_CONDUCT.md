# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

To ensure our project and community remain open and welcoming, we, as contributors and maintainers, commit to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. This includes respecting all individuals regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviors that help create a positive environment include:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Respect different viewpoints and experiences
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

Examples of behaviors that are not acceptable for participants include:

- Using sexualized language or imagery, or making unwelcome sexual advances
- Engaging in trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Harassing others, whether in public or private
- Sharing someone else's private information, such as physical or email addresses, without their explicit permission
- Engaging in any other behavior that could be considered inappropriate in a professional environment

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for defining acceptable behavior standards and are expected to take fair and appropriate corrective action when any instances of unacceptable behavior occur.

As stewards of the project, maintainers are empowered to modify or decline comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and any other contributions that do not adhere to this Code of Conduct. They also reserve the authority to temporarily or permanently bar any contributor whose conduct they judge as inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or detrimental to the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct is applicable in all project-related environments, whether they are internal project spaces or public spaces, whenever an individual is acting on behalf of the project or its community. Examples of such representation include using an official project email address, posting through an official social media account, or serving as a designated representative at online or offline events. The specifics of representing a project may be further elucidated by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

If you encounter instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please don't hesitate to report them to the project team at [lasse@famlam.ca](mailto:lasse@famlam.ca). Every complaint will be carefully reviewed and investigated, and appropriate action will be taken to address the situation. We assure you that confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident will be maintained by the project team. For more information on our enforcement policies, additional details may be provided separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
